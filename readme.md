Fancy SA Forums is an extension that makes the Something Awful forums prettier. It's styled after the recent SA front page design.

I maintain the Safari and Chrome versions of the extension in this repo. Kapinga maintains the Firefox version [here](https://github.com/kapinga/Fancy-SA-Forums-Firefox).
